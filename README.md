## Spam Email Detection using Logistic Regression - 

📘 Project Overview

- This project builds a Machine Learning model to classify emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Logistic Regression.
- Text data is converted into numerical form using the Bag-of-Words model (CountVectorizer), and the classifier learns to detect spam patterns based on word frequencies.

🧠 Objective

- To identify whether a given email message is spam or not spam based on its content using machine learning techniques.

📂 Dataset

- Source: SMS Spam Collection Dataset (UCI / GitHub)

Dataset Format:

- Separated by tabs (\t)

Columns:

- label → message type (spam / ham)
- text → actual message content

🧩 Steps Performed

- Data Loading – Loaded the dataset from GitHub using Pandas.
- Data Cleaning – Renamed columns and encoded target labels (ham = 1, spam = 0).
- Feature Extraction – Used CountVectorizer to convert text into numeric features.
- Train-Test Split – Split data into 80% training and 20% testing.
- Model Training – Trained a LogisticRegression classifier.
- Evaluation – Checked accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Visualization – Visualized confusion matrix using Seaborn heatmap.
- Testing – Predicted outcomes for new custom messages.
